- [x] Created `DashboardLayout` component with:
  - Professional header with system status indicator
  - Responsive sidebar navigation with 4 main sections
  - Model status display in sidebar
  - Clean, modern dark theme UI
- [x] Implemented 4 dashboard screens with placeholder content:
  1. **Real-Time Monitor** ([RealTimeMonitor.tsx](frontend/src/components/Dashboard/RealTimeMonitor.tsx))
     - Health status cards (Health Score, Anomaly Score, Temperature, RUL)
     - Placeholders for waveform and spectrum charts
     - Feature values display (RMS, Peak, Kurtosis, etc.)
     - Model predictions with ensemble scoring

  2. **Historical Analysis** ([HistoricalAnalysis.tsx](frontend/src/components/Dashboard/HistoricalAnalysis.tsx))
     - Summary statistics (Total Anomalies, Avg Health Score, Critical Events, Uptime)
     - Placeholder for health score trend chart
     - Anomaly timeline with severity indicators
     - Placeholder for feature correlation heatmap
     - Placeholder for performance degradation curve

  3. **Anomaly Details** ([AnomalyDetails.tsx](frontend/src/components/Dashboard/AnomalyDetails.tsx))
     - Critical anomaly alert display
     - Root cause analysis with attribution percentages
     - Feature importance (SHAP-like visualization)
     - Placeholder for frequency band analysis chart
     - Recommended actions with priority levels
     - Similar past events history

  4. **System Performance** ([SystemPerformance.tsx](frontend/src/components/Dashboard/SystemPerformance.tsx))
     - System overview metrics (Accuracy, Latency, CPU, Memory)
     - Model performance metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) for all 3 models
     - Ensemble performance summary
     - Confusion matrix visualization (last 7 days)
     - Inference performance (latency distribution, throughput)
     - Placeholder for resource usage chart
     - Drift detection status
     - Retraining recommendations

- [x] Configured routing in [App.tsx](frontend/src/components/App.tsx):
  - Routes for all 4 dashboard screens
  - BrowserRouter integration
  - Loading and error states

- [x] Enhanced global state management ([useAppStore.ts](frontend/src/store/useAppStore.ts)):
  - Added `sidebarCollapsed` state
  - Added `notifications` system for future alerts
  - Added `toggleSidebar()` action
  - Added `addNotification()` and `removeNotification()` actions

- [x] Testing:
  - Backend API running at `http://localhost:8000`
  - Frontend dev server running at `http://localhost:5173`
  - All routes accessible and navigable

### 🎨 UI/UX Features Implemented
- Dark theme with slate color palette
- Responsive grid layouts
- Active route highlighting in sidebar
- Status indicators with animations (pulse effects)
- Color-coded severity levels (normal/warning/critical)
- Professional card-based layouts
- Hover effects and transitions
- Placeholder content with clear labels for upcoming features
